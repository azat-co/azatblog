Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico is only 9-11 hours driving from the Bay Area. It's a relatively large port city that serves as tourist cruises port of call. It has nice Pacific Ocean views and great seafood. The commerce is thriving on the US border with street vendors, acrobats and windshield window washers.

Hard not to love this place.

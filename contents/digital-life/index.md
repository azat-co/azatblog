Needless to say that cafes, [open offices](http://azat.co/blog/open-offices), commute and slow internet all impede productivity. To increase efficiency, distraction-free [flow](http://azat.co/blog/flow) and productivity, I stayed home for a few days over the weekend to work on a project. 

I finished the project and made some money all digitally and remotely via the Internet and phone. I ordered food (groceries) using food delivery services. I worked out in a gym in my building and got fresh air on my patio. 

The result was an wierd feeling that I don't need to leave my home at all. It's almost magical to realize the digital inflow of money and digital outflow (to pay for food). Also, I was healthier because I cooked at home instead of eating out, and I didn't listen to gossips or read/watch news even in passing on a gym's TV or in metro.

It's fascinating that all can be done digitally witout leaving one's home and it's peculiar how little humans needs sometimes for productive, satisfactory and healthy live.

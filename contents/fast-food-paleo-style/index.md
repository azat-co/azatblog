Oftentimes, we are on the go, have to travel or just want to indulge in the staple of the [standard American diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_American_Diet) (SAD) â€” fast food. Personally, I find most fast food restaurants convenient. They are quick, offer a good value and have  predictable quality.

Here is what I order:

* Salad with proteins (chicken or beef) and without croutons/bread/corn/grains
* Burgers without buns, some places call them "wrapped in lettuces"

There's nothing wrong with treating yourself once in a while to a small side of french fries (with garlic, yum!) or a smoothie/milk shake. Even Mark Sisson says that we should't be hard on ourselves all the time ([80/20 rule](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/8020-principle/)). Just be careful not to make it a daily (or for some even a weekly trip can be dangerous) meal!

My favorite joints are:

* [SuperDuper Burgers](http://www.superdupersf.com/)
* Chipotle
* Panera
* Mixt Greens / Chop't
* McDonald's

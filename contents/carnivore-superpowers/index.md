It's been ten years since my [paleo superpowers](https://azat.co/blog/paleo-superpowers/) post. And while paleo is good, carnivore is even better. It's like having double the amount of superpowers, including but not limited to the following:

* More mental clarity and better problem solving.
* More more because less sleep is needed.
* Fewer sport injuries.
* Faster recovery from flu/cold, sickness, if I ever get it (typically not).
* Being able to skip meals and do multi-day water-only fasting.
* More energy, no sluggishness after meals.
* Calmer mood and better handling of stressful situations.
* Meal prep is 1-2 minutes because there are veggies that require most of the time to peel, slice and cook.
* It's easier to live because grocery shopping and restaurant menu choosing are much, much faster (less is more).

Carnivore diet and their variations (Lion Diet) are probably the best life hack out there. The facts are obvious:

* Carnivore is the evolutionary diet, that's how our ancestors ate and how humans evolved to eat.
* Animal food (i.e., meat) is the most nutrient and bio-available food.
* Carnivore is the ultimate elimination diet for autoimmune conditions.

It's been already proven to be the original human diet but sadly most doctors and people don't know about it. And even if they have heard about it, they dismiss it as dangerous or a fad. It'll be funny to look back in 20-40 years when the popular opinion will change to favor carnivore-like diets.

I'm not a huge fan of reading. In fact, I don't like reading. But I love getting better, finding out something new and useful.

You can talk only to few interesting people in-person. The limit is in time, location or just that they won't talk with you. Books are a transferable information. Good info can change career, life, relationships... everything!

So three years ago I start reading and logging books I read or listened to in a spreadsheet. Also, I was writing number of page or hours along with brief book summaries. I reached 200 with this breakdown:

* 2014: 33 books
* 2015: 67 books with 26 audio and 41 digital or print
* 2016: 101 books with 75 audio and 26 in digital or print

Just the audio books for 2016 amount to over 400 hours of content. That's 50 days of 8-hour listening per day. Almost all of the books were non-fiction. So here's what I learned:

* Books are not created equal: So books are junk or should be 50 not 350 pages because they don't have than much substance. Most modern non-fiction books are[ junk](http://azat.co/blog/ego-is-the-friend).
* Listening on 1.5x and speed reading rocks.
* I really don't like printed books. Kindle is a way to go!
* Successful people have different rules, habits, approaches which often contradict other successful people. Thus, don't listen to their advices. It's not what brought them success. (*Icons and Idiots* by Bob Lutz).
* History and biographies (especially auto biographies) tend to be the better books.
* Eat my frogs first to get things done.
* Black Swans can be good and bad. To benefit from good black swans, you have to take risk and action.
* Writing books is more fun than reading books. I should write a non-technical book next.
* Monopoly is good if you are the monopoly (*Zero to One*)
* Wheat, bread, and GMO are evil. I knew it before but it's good to be reminded.
* Why steak houses make you eat in darkness (*Mindless Eating*).
* Less is more (*The Paradox of Choice*).

That's more or less all. It's extremely hard to summarize books. The way they work, is that they take you on a journey and influence your subconscious. In the end you might have new ideas or perspective without realizing it's from a book.

Bonus! My top 5 list:

1. Antifragile
1. Deep Work
1. The Next 100 Years
1. Made in America
1. Grain Brain

Over the years of being on a paleo lifestyle, I've noticed that I don't want to go back to the S.A.D (Standard American Diet), for the reason that living on paleo feel is akin to **having superpowers**. I just don't want to give up these perks:

* **I don't get food coma**
* I don't crave sugary treats
* **I don't get cold or flu** as often (this year I took zero sick days!)
* I have more energy
* I can skip meals (when I travel or for fasting) and don't feel bad, exhausted or anxious
* I spend less time shopping because a lot of food options eliminated (cereals, breads, cakes, etc.)
* I have **more free time**

Why someone wouldn't want to be a real-life action hero?

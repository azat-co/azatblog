![PaleoFX 2016 Panel: Paleo is growing bigger and business helps it](panel.jpg)

I wrote before about how [being on a paleo lifestyle is like having superpowers](http://azat.co/blog/paleo-superpowers). Last week, I was lucky to attend PaleoFX, the biggest Paleo conference. It was kind of surreal to be around thousands of like-minded people, to see in-person almost all famous New York Times #1 Best-Sellers paleolebrities, and to be surrounded with all kinds of safe paleo-friendly food&drinks. Here are some of the highlights:

* Paleo business is growing: There were all kind of paleo flours, sweets, bars, powders, broths, fats and coffee infused with just about anything (butter, coconut, even mushrooms!).
* Paleolebrities are regular people: most of them hang out at the expo or after giving their presentations to answer questions. I took a picture with Robb Wolf with who's [book](http://amzn.to/1t8KS6J) my paleo journey started 6 years ago.
* There were insane number of healthy and fit looking people doing workout workshops (inspiring) as well as *average* looking people (making it less intimidating).
* Bone broth is liquid gold: I knew that broth is healing but after listening to [Dr. Kellyann](http://amzn.to/1VDS2dY) I decided to become disciplined about drinking 2 cups of bone broth. Her protocol is bone broth for 21 days and fast 1-2 days per week.
* [Ben Greenfield's presentation](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/paleo16) was full of bio hacks to increase cognitive performance like jaw realignment, morning brain flush, infra-red saunas, yoga, low intensity PEMF and others.
* Our gut bacteria has more DNA material than we: [Dr. Perlmutter](http://amzn.to/1VDS2uC) gave a great presentation reinforcing the importance of our gut biome. One of the analogies stuck with me: we uploaded our DNA/genes to the cloud which is our gut bacteria.
* Lack of sleep is aging and killing you faster: Just one night of sleep deprivation increases aging 10-15 years (temporarily) and decreases cognitive functions.
* It's harder to legally sell raw milk than marijuana (in some cases).
* [A lot of science is not reliable](https://www.instagram.com/p/BF_4shkiXN9/?taken-by=azatmardan), because studies to replicate findings and peer reviews are disincentivized.

Overall, it was a great event to reinforce familiar, and learn new things about paleo lifestyle. I also got a lot of contacts for paleo-friendly web stores, products and services which will make my life on the paleo lifestyle even easier than before!

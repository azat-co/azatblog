Be ignorant about everything except two or three things you are really interested about. Those things are your priorities and dream goals. Everything else is a distraction.

The myth that we can do everything, should know about a variety of subjects and accomplish everything is just a myth. **You cannot be everywhere and do everything...** If you try, the outcome is mediocrity.

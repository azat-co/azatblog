# My 2016: Year Review in Numbers

What you don't track, you can improve. Therefore, it's a good idea to collect some numbers on the passed year:

* Miles flown
* Conferences attended
* Conference talks given
* Workshops given
* Books read
* Books listened to
* Podcasts listened to
* YouTube videos watched
* Movies watched
* Vacations taken
* Books written: 2; kind of, because I re-wrote React Quickly almost entirely and published a spin off React Native Quickly
* Online courses produced: 
* GitHub commits made:
* Emails received
* Emails sent

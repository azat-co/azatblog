After reading Nassim Taleb's great book [Antifragile](http://amzn.to/2hsHHE6), I saw how one can apply the [barbell theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbell_strategy), which he described in the book, to building a career in tech:

* **Focus 80-90% of fundamentals** like algorithms, data structures, specifications (W3C), standards (ECMAScript), etc.: These concepts are less prone to changes.
* *Focus 10-20% on riskier but more promising new things* which haven't even been discovered by early adopters let alone the early majority.
* Focus 0 on stuff in the middle

If your bet on 20% of the riskier stuff is correct, you'll be ahead of the [Rogers' bell curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle). If not, then you are still safe with your 80% in the fundamentals. Maybe you even learned something like a special pattern which can be applied to another concept or language in the future. For example, functional programming.

In my career, I followed the Barbell Theory without knowing about it. I got bachelors and masters degrees, the safest bet one can make. Then I focused on web development which is NOT very exciting but very ubiquitous and always in demand. That's my 80%.

Then, I branched out into Node.js which was very controversial in 2011-2012. Node.js is mainstream now. Also, I started writing books which is one of the most riskier activities to do (high chance of failure).

In his book [Quitter](http://amzn.to/2hXl1ZI), Jon Acuff starts the narrative with advice NOT to quit a job. I agree with him 150%. It's way better and easier to take long-term riskier and more impactful bets when you have your steady base. Your 80%. I did my writing while still holding a full-time job. That's barbell again. Moreover, teaching in-person and online, working full-time job, and writing fed one of another. Writing and teaching made me a better developer and vice versa.

So start a project on a weekend. Pick up a new language and read learn it over the holidays. If there's a book on the language or frameworkâ€”it's too late. IGNORE the stuff in the middle. Ignore the noise, but know about the trends, and see a big one you can jump on while still standing on a solid ground. That's the barbell theory in action.

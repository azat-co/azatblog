![Bogota and Medellin, Colombia 2023](medellin-23.jpeg)

Here are my key impressions from a recent trip to Colombia, to the cities of Bogota and Medellin.

-   Nicer parts of cites like Park 93, Verrey or El Poblado are very walkable and very European and less "American" (i.e., big roads, must have cars, not walkable).

-   The food is more european with less salsas and spices

-   Bogota is cold but again it reminded me of European cloudy skies in Scandinavia, London or Russia.

-   There are a lot of hookah places in El Poblado and in Bogota they have small shops with tables on the streets to smoke

-   There are a lot of peddlers and beggars on the street that are very persistent and annoying.

-   People love bicycles, running and their dogs.Â 

-   There are a lot of greens (trees, bushes, grass).

-   Meat is superb and has a very natural grass-fed flavor.

-   Avianca tries to be a low-cost airline charging for everything extra (seat selection, soda, juice, small roller suitcase).

-   Roads are good and tunnels are moderns but traffic in rush hours suck. Even Pico y Placa doesn't help. It's better to walk or take a bike, or ride motorbike if you're local.

-   Bogota restaurants are better than Medellin restaurants.

-   Bogota hotels are cheaper than Medellin hotels.

-   Uber can call a regular taxi.

-   Cash is not needed for a week-long trip except to buy fruits from street vendors who are too lazy to get a card terminal.

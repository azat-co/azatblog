# 5 Easy Tips to Create More Time in Your Life

Being busy has became a badge of honor. For me, it's stupid. I do a lot of things but I'm not busy. In fact, one of the questions people ask me a lot is "How do you find time?" 

First of all, you can find it. It's not a jacket which you left at a girl's place after partying in a night club. You can't find time or lose it... but you can spend it on stupid things and on good things.

Examples of stupid thing I avoid doing:

* Reading Facebook timeline
* Looking at Instagram news feed
* Checking my Twitter feed and when I do I subscribe to more than about 200 people so I'm look into "In case you missed it"
* Watching movies - I only watch movies trailers in planes that's enough to see all the good scenes and in 80% of the cases understand the plot... but even that makes me want to puke either because modern movies are so brain-dead or full of loser-oriented propaganda (e.g., Hangover)
* Watching TV and commercials, get Netflix or Amazon Prime if you want some dumb entertainment
* Answer survey
* Write reviews
* Read popular magazines
* Text with friends - just freaking call or talk in person when you want talk, and use text is only for scheduling hangouts
* Be tired because when you are tired you want to take a break, a long weekend or a vacation. Don't get tired in the first place! To do so, eat property, exercise and good sleep.
